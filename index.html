                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>My name is Luvneesh Mugrai and welcome to my site. In case you are curious to know about me. I am currently attending New York University Tandon School of Engineering and pursing a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science, with two minors in Game Engineering and Integrated Digital Media. I have been developing games since high school and now am working with two friends on our attempt at a startup, Gilly Works. A number of my games are available on my GitHub and include ways to be able to download and play each. I also linked a few of them here over on the Projects Page.</p>
                <p>I have been making strides to expand my knowledge and explore new areas, such as Web Development, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. For the prior two, I have been taking courses at my college and working on some projects, such as this website. As for the ladder of the three, I currently an artificial intelligence researching assistant at the Game Innovation Lab at NYU Tandon. I am responsible for developing an AI to mimic human player gameplay for a game, Awkward Date, created by the PhD student for whom I am working.</p>
                <p>Feel free to contact me anytime by email if you want to discuss some of my projects, experience, or just want someone with whom you may talk. </p>
                <p>So now you know, this is me.</p>

                    <h1>Aspirations</h1>
                    <p>Watching Star Trek as a kid, I fell in love with the idea of a Holodeck and virtual reality. Now I aspire to not only enter the virtual reality industry, but also find that merger between virtual reality and gaming and break it wide open. I want to develop and immersive room that places you directly in the center of a game, is fully interactive and has the same feel as that from the Holodeck.</p>
