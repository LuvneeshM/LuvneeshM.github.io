                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>My name is Luvneesh Mugrai and welcome to my site. In case you are curious to know about me. I am currently attending New York University Tandon School of Engineering and pursing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science, with two minors in Game Engineering and Integrated Digital Media. </p>
                    <p>I have been developing games since high school and now am working with two friends on our attempt at a startup, Gilly Works. A number of my games are available on my GitHub and include ways to be able to download and play each. I also linked a few of them here over on the Projects Page.</p>
                    <p>I have been making strides to expand my knowledge and explore new areas, such as Web Development, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. For the prior two, I have been taking courses at my college and working on some projects, such as this website. As for the ladder of the three, I currently an artificial intelligence researching assistant at the Game Innovation Lab at NYU Tandon. I am responsible for developing an AI to mimic human player gameplay for a game, Awkward Date, created by the PhD student for whom I am working.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to contact me anytime by email if you want to discuss some of my projects, experience, or just want someone with whom you may talk. </p>
                    <p>So now you know, this is me.</p>

                    <h2>Aspirations</h2>
                    <p>Watching Star Trek as a kid, I fell in love with the idea of a Holodeck and virtual reality. Now I aspire to not only enter the virtual reality industry, but also find that merger between virtual reality and gaming and break it wide open. I want to develop and immersive room that places you directly in the center of a game, is fully interactive and has the same feel as that from the Holodeck.</p>

                <div class="FAQ">
                    <h2>FAQ</h2>
                    <h3>What languages do you know?</h3>
                    <p>C/C++; Java; Python; HTML; CSS; JavaScript</p>
                    <h3>Why computer science?</h3>
                    <p>It blows my mind with what you are able to accomplish when in the driver seat, writing the programs. To add to this, I enjoy the freedom of being able to do something in way that suits me and having the power of being in control, making the technology do as I program.</p>
                    <h3>What bores you?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Presentations in which a person uses a PowerPoint to only read off the screen</li>
                        <li>Talking to non-opinionated people</li>
                        <li>Having to listen to the same stories when you meet you relatives</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What gets you out of bed?</h3>
                    <p>Knowing that every day is a day of its own, I make it a personal goal to be able to learn or at least think about one new thing outside of my normal spectrum. By normal spectrum I mean outside of what I study. For example, while typing this up, today I thought about force fields and how scary they might actually be in real life.</p>
                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>My two responses are "Why not?" and "Because."</p>
